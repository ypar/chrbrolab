I have setup some docs and non-pmacs workspace for convenience of chrbrolab members. I no longer maintain any of these but I list a few that will continue to be useful for incoming members of the group.



# slack

I have set up a slack workspace for chrbrolab members. If you are new to the group, cdb and mc are now admins and can give you access.




# gdrive

There are several documentations and meeting schedules, etc. maintained and shared in the lab gdrive. Contact cdb to give you access. 



# gcp

I have made a lab account for a shared google cloud platform access. This is useful for collaborative projects. Contact me and cdb if you want to ask for access.




# dropbox

This is seldom used but will be useful if you have lab protocols, etc. that need to be shared. Contact gh to give you the user account information.
